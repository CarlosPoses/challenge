        "# Introduction\n",
        "`git` and `GitHub` are tools that allow you to create a visible portfolio of your work. This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating a new repository on `GitHub`, forking the repository, creating a new branch, adjusting the compendium, creating a pull request, reviewing the pull request, and merging the pull request.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, we will make the portfolio visible by creating a website rendering and publishing our `Quarto` document to `GitHub Pages`.\n",
        "\n",
        "## `Git`\n",
        "\n",
        "`Git` is a free and open source version control system for text files. It can handle extensive change logging for you, no matter the size of the project. `Git` is fast and efficient, but its effectiveness depends also on the frequency you instruct it to log your project's changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can see `Git` as a blank canvas that starts at a certain point in time. Every time you (or others) instruct `Git` to log any changes that have been made, `Git` adds the changes that are made to this canvas. We call the changes to the canvas [`commits`](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#commit). With every `commit` an extensive log is created that includes at least the following information:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   the changes made\n",
        "-   who made the changes\n",
        "-   metadata\n",
        "-   a small piece of text that describe the changes made\n",
        "\n",
        "The difference between two commits - or the changes between them - are called [`diffs`](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#diff).\n",
        "\n",
        "If you'd like to know much more about `Git`, [this online book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is a very good resource. If you'd like to practice with the command line interface [use this webpage](https://learngitbranching.js.org) for a quick course. [This book](https://happygitwithr.com) covers pretty much everything you need to marry `Git` and `R`.\n",
        "\n",
        "## `GitHub`\n",
        "\n",
        "`GitHub` is the social and user interface to `Git` that allows you to work in [repositories](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#repository). These repositories can be seen as project folders in which you publish your work, but you can also use them as test sites for development, testing, etcetera. There is a distinction between [private repositories](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#private-repository) (only for you and those you grant access) and public repositories (visible for everyone).\n",
        "\n",
        "Your public repositories can be viewed and [forked](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#fork) by everyone. `Forking` is when other people create a copy of your repository on their own account. This allows them to work on a repository without affecting the `master`. You can also do this yourself, but then the process is called [`branching`](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#branch) instead of forking. If you create a copy of a repository that is offline, the process is called [`cloning`](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#clone).\n",
        "\n",
        "`GitHub`'s ability to branch, fork and clone is very useful as it allows other people and yourself to experiment on (the code in) a repository before any definitive changes are [`merged`](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#merge) with the `master`. If you're working in a forked repository, you can submit a [`pull request`](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request) to the repository collaborators to accept (or reject) any suggested changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "For now, this may be confusing, but I hope you recognize the benefits `GitHub` can have on the process of development and bug-fixing. For example, the most up-to-date version of the `mice` package in `R` can be directly installed from the `mice` repository with the following code:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "```{markdown}\n",
        "install.packages(\"devtools\")\n",
        "devtools::install_github(repo = \"stefvanbuuren/mice\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "You can see that this process requires package `devtools` that expands the `R` functionality with essential development tools. Loading packages in `R` directly from their respective `GitHub` repositories, allows you to obtain the latest - often improved and less buggy - iteration of that software even before it is published on [`CRAN`](https://cran.r-project.org).\n",

        "\n",
